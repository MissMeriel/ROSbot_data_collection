# ROSbot Setup

This document contains instructions to set up the data collection scripts on your ROSbot so you can run these scripts natively and collect a dataset.

Hardware required:
* ROSbot
* Wireless Xbox controller
* small form-factor external USB drive (like [this one](https://a.co/d/4fmXYWw))
* Bluetooth 4.0 dongle (like [this one](https://a.co/d/e7X3SpB))


## Initial Setup Instructions

N.B. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND SKIM THE TROUBLESHOOTING SECTION BEFORE YOU BEGIN. 
This will make setup a lot faster as you can make sure you have everything you need ready to go (keyboard, mouse, bluetooth dongle, wifi connection...).

1. Plug the USB drive into a computer and format the USB drive as Fat32 (see Troubleshooting). Reformat the drive if needed. Be sure to retain a copy of the data on your local computer if reformatting is required. 
2. Copy `start_rosbotxl.sh` file and `src` directory to your USB drive. Plug the USB drive into your ROSbot.
3. Connect to your ROSbot (ssh, plug in a monitor and mouse/keyboard, etc.).
4. Copy `start_rosbotxl.sh` to  `/home/husarion`.  In linux this directory has a shortcut, `~` and is always in location `/home/$USER` like /home/husarion. This is the script that will allow drivers and data collection scripts to start on boot. 
5. Give `start_rosbotxl.sh` executable permissions by running `chmod +x start_rosbotxl.sh`.
6. Copy the `datacoll` package inside `src` to `~/husarion_ws/src`.
7. Add executable permissions to all `.py` scripts in the `datacoll` package: `cd ~/husarion_ws/src/datacoll/src; chmod +x *.py`
8. `cd ~/husarion_ws; source devel/setup.bash`
9. Refer to the instructions [here](https://husarion.com/tutorials/howtostart/rosbotxl-quick-start/#connecting-rosbot-to-your-wi-fi-network) to connect your ROSbot to wifi or ethernet. 
   1. To Connect to UVA hidden open network "wahoo":
        1. Type command `sudo ifconfig` and find your wireless interface named as `wlan0` or `wifi0`. 
        2. Copy the MAC Address of your ROSbot, which is listed in six groups of two hexadecimal digits.
        3. Register your MAC Address following the step 2 on [this instruction](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=ca13d12bdb8153404f32fb671d961969) 
        4. Edit the `01-network-manager-all.yaml` file through `sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml`.\
           In the file, set 
            ```
             wifis:
               wlan0:
                 dhcp4: true
                 dhcp6: true
                 optional: true
                 access-points:
                   "wahoo": 
                      hidden: true
           ```
        5. To configure netplan, save the `01-network-manager-all.yaml` file, then run `sudo netplan -d apply`.
10. Install the `joy_node` package: `sudo apt install ros-<distro>-joy`. Refer to the Installing Packages section of troubleshooting for determining your distro and updating your ros repo and authentication.
11. Install `bluez` and its command line interface, `bluetoothctl` by running: ` sudo apt install bluez`. It may have been installed by a previous user.
12. Run `sudo service bluetooth start; bluetoothctl scan on`. Try connecting your Xbox controller to the bluetooth. 
Refer to the "First time connecting your controller to the ROSbot" section if this is your first time connecting. 
Refer to troubleshooting if your bluetooth is disconnecting and reconnecting.
13. Try running the startup script: `./start_rosbotxl.sh`. If you experience errors, refer to troubleshooting.
14. If steps #11-12 run smoothly, add `./start_rosbotxl.sh` to your startup routine. For more detailed instructions and screenshots, see section below on adding scripts to your startup routine.
    1. In the terminal enter the command: `chmod +x $HOME/start_rosbotxl.sh`
    2. In the terminal enter the command: `crontab -e`
    3. At the end of the crontab file, add `@reboot $HOME/start_rosbotxl.sh`
16. Test if your script starts on startup. Turn off your ROSbot and turn it back on again. The LiDAR turret should spin within 20-30 seconds. Let it run for a few seconds and then check the external USB drive to see if the dataset wrote to disk.
17. Follow the instructions linked [here](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/controller/update-xbox-wireless-controller) to update the Xbox controller firmware.
18. If step #10 goes smoothly, refer to [README.md](README.md) "ROSbot Setup" section for running the ROSbot. If you experience errors, refer to troubleshooting.

## Adding scripts to your startup routine on HusarionOS
1. Go to Dash and type "Start" into the search bar. On HusarionOS, this is the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the screen.

## First time connecting your controller to the ROSbot

You should have your Xbox controller's MAC address before you begin. The easiest way to find it out is to connect it to a bluetooth-enabled laptop and inspect the device using your bluetooth settings.

1. You should also have `bluez` already installed on your ROSbot. Find out by running `bluetoothctl`. If not, run `sudo apt install bluetoothctl`.
2. Run `sudo service bluetooth restart; bluetoothctl`. This will take you into the bluetoothctl prompt.
3. Within the bluetoothctl prompt, run `devices` to list all Bluetooth devices that have been paired/currently connected to your ROSbot 
4. Within the bluetoothctl prompt, run `remove <listed-device-MAC>` if there are devices shown from last step
5. Within the bluetoothctl prompt, run `scan on` and set your Xbox controller in pairing mode. The Xbox controller with its MAC address will show up as `Xbox Wireless Controller` in your terminator.  
6. Within the bluetoothctl prompt, run `connect <your-controller-MAC>`
7. You should see output similar to `Connection successful` and the prompt should change to
`[Xbox Wireless Controller]#`. The light on the Xbox controller should shine steadily. If not, or if the prompt shows the controller disconnecting and reconnecting, refer to Troubleshooting.

To exit the bluetoothctl prompt, type `quit` or `exit`.

## Troubleshooting

### Formatting a USB drive as Fat32

On Mac: (link)[https://4ddig.tenorshare.com/usb-recovery/format-usb-drive-to-fat32-on-mac.html]

On Windows 10/11: (link)[https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1044735/]

On Linux: (link)[https://linuxhint.com/format-usb-drive-linux/]

### Installing Packages
The apt repository preinstalled on the ROSbot may be stale and may require an update. 
Check your ros distro by running `rosverion -d` or `ls /opt/ros`.
If you cannot install new ros packages using `apt`, [update your apt repository](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) if necessary.

To install new packages from ROS and Husarion, you will need to update two GPG keys in order to access those apt repositories.
If your ROSbot was manufactured before June 2022, then ROS has updated their GPG key since your ROSbot's software was installed.

### WiFi and Bluetooth
If you are using a wireless network and intend to operate the ROSbot outside that network, test your ROSbot startup routine when not connected to that network. 
You may need to disable the WiFi on your ROSbot to successfully complete the startup routine. 
You may also want to change the `ROS_IP` set in `start_rosbot.sh`.

Fix for controller bluetooth disconnect-reconnect: [Bluetooth Problem Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1040497/bluetooth-problem-ubuntu-18-04-lts)

### Bluetooth controller connection fix

1. Ensure bluetooth service is started "sudo service bluetooth start"
2. start bluetoothctl via "bluetoothctl" in the command line
3. systemctl restart bluetooth
4. forget [Xbox Wireless Controller] (via the Xbox Controller's mac address)
5. remove [Xbox Wireless Controller]
6. set Xbox controller to pairable mode
7. set pairable on
8. start scan via "scan on"
9. connect [Xbox Wireless Controller]

### Updating Husarnet repo key

Husarion changed the ca certficate to its husarnet repo in 2021. You may need to update yours if your ROSbot shipped prior to June 2021.
See this series of [community posts](https://community.husarion.com/t/husarion-repository-expired-key/1240/3).
```
sudo su root # The following command needs to be run as root
curl https://install.husarnet.com/repo.key 22 | apt-key add -
<ctrl-d> # revert to husarion prompt (The following commands shouldâ€™t be run as root)
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates
sudo apt update
```

### Husarion OS (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS OS)
To check the current OS version in Linux, open the Terminator and type `lsb_release -a`
